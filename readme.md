## Models

This module introduces two new models to the Odoo database:

### 1. Transport Mission (`transport.mission`)

This is the main model that represents a single transport job.
-   `name`: The unique reference (e.g., TM/00001).
-   `mission_date`: The date of the mission.
-   `driver_id`: A many-to-one link to a Partner (Driver).
-   `vehicle_id`: A many-to-one link to a Vehicle.
-   `destination_ids`: A one-to-many link to the `transport.destination` model.
-   `state`: The current status of the mission.

### 2. Transport Destination (`transport.destination`)

This model holds the details for each stop in a mission.
-   `mission_id`: A many-to-one link back to the parent mission.
-   `location`: A text field for the destination address or point.
-   `sequence`: An integer to define the order of the stops.

## Technical Details

-   **Dependencies:** This module depends on the following official Odoo apps:
    -   `base`: The core Odoo framework.
    -   `fleet`: For vehicle management (`fleet.vehicle` model).
    -   `mail`: For the chatter and activity features (`mail.thread` and `mail.activity.mixin`).
-   **Sequencing:** It uses an `ir.sequence` record to automatically generate mission reference numbers upon creation.

## Installation

1.  Place this module's folder (or a symbolic link to it) inside your Odoo `custom_addons` directory.
2.  Restart the Odoo server service.
3.  In the Odoo UI, navigate to the **Apps** menu.
4.  Click **Update Apps List** (Developer Mode may need to be activated).
5.  Search for "Transport Management" and click **Install**.

## Quick Start

1.  After installation, navigate to **Transport** in the main Odoo menu
2.  Go to **Transport** ‚Üí **Missions** to view all missions
3.  Click **New** to create a mission with the interactive map planner
4.  Use **Transport** ‚Üí **Overview Map** for real-time mission monitoring

### Creating Your First Mission
1. Click the map to set your source location
2. Right-click to add destination points
3. Drag markers to adjust positions
4. Use the "Test API Connection" button to optimize routes
5. Confirm and start your mission
